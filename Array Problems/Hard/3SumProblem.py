#Time Complexity: O(NlogN)+O(N2), where N = size of the array.
# Reason: The pointer i, is running for approximately N times. And both the pointers j and k combined can
# run for approximately N times including the operation of skipping duplicates. So the total time complexity will be O(N2). 

# Space Complexity: O(no. of quadruplets), This space is only used to store the answer. We are not using any extra space to
# solve this problem. So, from that perspective, space complexity can be written as O(1).
