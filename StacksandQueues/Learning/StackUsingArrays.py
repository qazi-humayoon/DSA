# In computer science, a stack is a data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.
# This means that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. A stack can be envisioned
# as a collection of elements with two main operations:

# Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
# Pop: Removes the element from the top of the stack.
# A stack is often used in situations where the order of processing is important and where the most recently added
# element should be the first to be processed. Think of it like a stack of plates in a cafeteria â€“ you add a plate 
# to the top of the stack, and when you want to take a plate, you take it from the top.

# Key characteristics of a stack:

# LIFO Order: The last element added is the first one to be removed.
# Two Main Operations: Push (to add) and Pop (to remove).
# Top: The position where the last element was added.
# Size: The number of elements in the stack.
# Common use cases for stacks include parsing expressions, function call management (call stack),
# and undo mechanisms in software applications. In programming languages, a call stack is often 
# used to keep track of function calls and returns.

#TC O(N)
# SC O(N)
